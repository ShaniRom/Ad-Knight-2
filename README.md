# Ad-Knight 2
We made our final project with a start up, which requested a program that reads CSV files and lets you preview the data on a chart.

In this project we used VITE, React, SCSS, Typescript and Node.
The node libraries used:
- papaparse
- react-chartjs-2 v4

**How to Install and Run the Project-**
You need to write in the terminal- npm i 
which installs everything in the express
Then type  - npm run dev


**How to Use the Project-**
You click the choose file button and select your CSV file
When you begin it automatically  goes through papaparse and then matches the  0.8.5 version of headers to match to your csvs columns.
Then you choose by the side filter bar in what way you want to see your data, by what catergories, by which timestamps and how much of the data you want see in each page.
On the right you see the datasets that you've chosen to see your data by, which is presented by color,id and by the y axios parameters like "1234543 BLE rssi_0"
At the bottom of the chart there are scrolling options to see different pages by the amount youve chosen to see in each page.
There are two buttons on the bottom of the filter bar. One to turn the data that is presented on the chart into a CSV file, and another button that saves an image of the chart.

-If you want to change the data amount press submit and then press the submit on top of it that is in the timestamp filter.
